# MERN Stack Interview Preparation

Welcome, This repository documents the interview questions, answers and core concepts I am verifying and learning as I prepare for MERN stack roles. It focuses on the essentials for **Frontend** and **Basic Backend** interviews.

> 🚧 **Work in Progress** 🚧
>
> **Note:** I am currently preparing for my interviews, so this repository is a work in progress. This repository serves as a living document of my current study progress 🧑‍💻. I am constantly adding new topics and refining existing ones as I learn.

## 📚 What's Inside?

This guide covers the most common and practical topics for **entry-level** and **junior** positions, skipping unnecessary clutter:

- **🌐 HTML** 
- **🌐 CSS**
- **⚙️ JavaScript**
- **⚛️ React**
- **🔷 TypeScript**
- **🛠️ Backend Basics (Node.js, Express, and MongoDB)**
- **🧩 Machine Coding Round**

## 📂 Structure

Each folder generally contains:
1.  **Interview Questions**: Common questions with direct answers.
2.  **Concepts**: Simplified explanations to help understand the 'why' and 'how'.

> **Note:** You might spot some grammatical or spelling errors. But hey, coding is more important, right? So, please overlook those slip-ups and focus on what truly matters: your code.
