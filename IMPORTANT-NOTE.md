## 📝 Important Note: Better Comments for VS Code

I’m using the Better Comments VS Code extension to highlight important notes, questions, concepts, answers, and other stuff with different colors. This makes it easier to identify key points while coding.

> ⚠️ Note: This is not necessary. If you use it, you’ll get a more visually enhanced experience with colored highlights. Otherwise, all notes, concepts, questions, answers, and other stuff will appear in normal text form. This extension is purely optional and intended to improve readability and organization while coding. It doesn’t affect functionality in any way.

Installation:

1. Open VS Code.
2. Go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`).
3. Search for Better Comments and install it.

Use this setting (optional but recommended):

```json
"better-comments.tags": [
  {
    "tag": "#",
    "color": "red",
    "strikethrough": false,
    "underline": false,
    "backgroundColor": "transparent",
    "bold": true,
    "italic": false
  },
  {
    "tag": "--",
    "color": "green",
    "strikethrough": false,
    "underline": false,
    "backgroundColor": "transparent",
    "bold": false,
    "italic": false
  },
  {
    "tag": "?",
    "color": "white",
    "strikethrough": false,
    "underline": false,
    "backgroundColor": "transparent",
    "bold": false,
    "italic": false
  },
  {
    "tag": ">",
    "color": "yellow",
    "strikethrough": false,
    "underline": false,
    "backgroundColor": "transparent",
    "bold": false,
    "italic": false
  }
]
```

💡 Tip: You can customize these colors and tags based on your preferences. The main goal is to make your all notes, concepts, questions, answers, and other stuff more visible and structured, especially when working on large projects or revising your code.

This setup helps me quickly identify important notes, tasks, or reminders without getting lost in the code. Again, it’s completely optional, but it can make your coding workflow a lot smoother and more organized.
